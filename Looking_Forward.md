## Looking Forward 
In this class, we explored a range of topics related to digital humanities and how computational methods can provide new insights . Moving forward, there are three key areas I plan to pursue to build upon the foundation established in this course:

Dive deeper into macroanalysis and computational analysis of literature. The book "Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History" by Matthew L. Jockers provides a compelling overview of how analyzing large collections of digital texts can surface new understandings and trends that are not apparent from close reading of individual works alone. By studying this book in detail, I hope to gain hands-on skills in applying computational analysis to literary corpora and consider how these approaches could augment traditional methods of literary interpretation.
Examine the societal implications of big data and algorithms. Katie Rawson and Trevor Muñoz's thought-provoking piece "Against Cleaning" touched upon vital issues regarding the subjective choices and inherent biases that can become embedded in and perpetuated by data sets. To further explore this crucial topic, I plan to read "Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy" by Cathy O'Neil. This book takes a critical look at the rise of algorithms and their often unregulated and opaque usage in decisions that significantly impact people's lives. Studying O'Neil's analysis will provide valuable context for considering the ethical dimensions of applying computational methods.
Learn additional digital fabrication techniques through hands-on workshops. Creating the 3D model for the Education Commons project was a highlight of this class for me. I'm eager to expand my knowledge of digital fabrication by attending workshops focused on other tools like the laser cutter once the Education Commons releases their schedule of offerings for next semester. Developing familiarity with a range of fabrication methods will open up new avenues for incorporating physical representations into future digital humanities projects.
