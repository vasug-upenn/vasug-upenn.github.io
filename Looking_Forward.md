## Looking Forward 
In this class, we explored a range of topics related to digital humanities and how computational methods can provide new insights . Moving forward, there are three key areas I plan to pursue to build upon the foundation established in this course:
* Read "Macroanalysis: Digital Methods and Literary History" by Matthew L. Jockers. I'm interested in learning more about how analyzing large collections of digital texts can reveal new insights about literature and culture. This book provides a great introduction to the methods and potential of this approach. I think it will help me understand how to apply computational analysis to literature in meaningful ways.
* Learn more about the social and ethical implications of big data by reading "Weapons of Math Destruction" by Cathy O'Neil. The piece "Against Cleaning" by Katie Rawson and Trevor Muñoz got me thinking about how biases can get baked into data and algorithms. O'Neil's book dives into how this plays out in the real world and impacts things like education, jobs, and democracy. I'm curious to explore this angle more to help me think critically about the limitations and consequences of the computational methods we studied.
* Attend some digital fabrication workshops at the Education Commons next semester. I really enjoyed the 3D modeling project we did and want to try out some of the other tools they have, like laser cutters. Hands-on experience will help me get a better grasp on different fabrication techniques and how I could use them in future projects. The workshops seem like a great chance to learn the basics and meet other people interested in these methods.
