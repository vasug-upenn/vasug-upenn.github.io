## About Me
I'm Vasu Gupta, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a degree in biochemistry. This semester, I had the opportunity to learn about and egage with the field of digital humanities. This course challenged me to think critically about the relationship between technology and the humanities, and how digital tools can reshape the way we engage with cultural and historical material.
